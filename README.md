# Chat with your data

You'll get far just by following instructions here: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/

Some pitfalls you'll come across: 

1. OpenAI created objects need to pass in openai_api_key
2. Not all libraries are included, you'll need to pip install this and that to get through.
3. You'll need some OpenAI credit

To use this repo, create chroma dbs in docs and testdocs (check myown.ipynb)
